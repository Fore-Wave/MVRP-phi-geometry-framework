# MVRP Phlossary
## Physics + Philosophy + Phenomena Glossary

### What is the Phlossary?

The **Phlossary** is an interdisciplinary glossary combining:
- **Physics:** Hard science definitions (measurements, equations)
- **Philosophy:** Conceptual frameworks (meaning, interpretation)  
- **Phenomena:** Observed effects (what actually happens)

Created in "Evanese" style - accessible technical language that bridges 
mainstream physics with frontier concepts.

### Contents

**Rounds 1-3** (Full glossary, ~120 terms)
- File: `phlossary_rounds_1-3.pdf`
- Status: Complete
- Coverage: Core concepts from Z-pinch, longitudinal waves, scalar phenomena, 
  fractality, coherence, golden ratio, and more

**Round 4** (Latest additions, ~30 terms)
- File: `phlossary_round_4.pdf`
- Status: Work in progress
- New terms: Infinite-Gain Loop, Qualia, Retro-causality, Ebner Effect, 
  Kowsky-Frost Crystal, Rodin Coil, and more

**MVRP Core Subset** (15 most relevant terms)
- File: `phlossary_mvrp_core.md`
- Status: Active reference
- Focus: Terms directly applicable to MVRP experiments

### How to Use

**For Quick Reference:**
- Start with `phlossary_mvrp_core.md` (MVRP-specific terms)
- Expand to full glossary as needed

**For Deep Dive:**
- Read Rounds 1-3 for comprehensive foundation
- Check Round 4 for latest experimental concepts

**For Collaboration:**
- Share with new collaborators as onboarding resource
- Provides common vocabulary across disciplines

### Tier System

Terms are classified by certainty level:

- **Tier 1:** Established physics (Golden Ratio, Lorentz Force, Lenz's Law)
- **Tier 2:** Testable hypotheses (Magneto-Acoustics, Electroacoustic Coupling)
- **Tier 3:** Speculation (Retro-causality, Qualia, Charge Collapse)

### Evolution

The Phlossary is a living document:
- Rounds 1-3: Foundation established
- Round 4: In progress, adding MVRP-specific terms
- Round 5: Planned additions based on experimental discoveries

### Integration with MVRP

Key Phlossary terms directly support MVRP framework:
- φ-Spacing (golden ratio electrode geometry)
- Magneto-Acoustics (magnetic + sonic induction)
- Electro-Acoustics (acoustic → electric conversion)
- Harmonic Inclusiveness (synergy mechanism)
- Coherence (voltage persistence, beam collimation)

See `phlossary_mvrp_core.md` for complete MVRP-relevant subset.
