Laser Experiments Background
## Multi-Year Optical Research (Pre-MVRP)

### Timeline
Started: may 2024
Duration: 2 plus years / current 
Total experiments: ~57 documented via video, plus others outside of these
Public documentation: 10+ videos in playlist

### Primary Discovery: Optical-Acoustic Coupling

**Setup:**
- Two lasers green, blue and purple
- Pyramid prism, dodecahedron prism, Pink Floyd style prism, cube, and orb
- Rose quartz crystal, amethyst quartz crystal 
- Magnets neodymium for most of the set ups 

**Observation:**
Bass frequency hum (audible sound) generated when:
- Dual laser beams intersect in pyramid
- Beam passes through rose quartz
- Recursive interference occurs (beam "hitting itself")

**Characteristics:**
- Frequency: ~50-100 Hz (bass range, estimated by ear)
- Volume: Audible in quiet room
- Repeatability: Consistent across multiple trials
- Duration: While lasers active

**Interpretation:**
- Optical energy → Acoustic energy transduction
- Rose quartz: Piezoelectric crystal (EM ↔ mechanical)
- Pyramid geometry: Focused interference pattern
- Recursive build: Standing wave formation
- Mechanism: Possibly thermal expansion, radiation pressure, 
  or piezoelectric coupling

**Significance:**
Cross-domain energy transduction mediated by:
1. Crystal properties (piezoelectric)
2. Geometric focusing (pyramid)
3. Wave interference (recursive build)

**Tier Classification:** 2 (observed, repeatable, mechanism speculative)

### Other Observations
- Cube effect of dual lasers forming inside dodecahedron prism
- Purple and green lasers combined to make what looked like white output
- Cold sensation from laser beam, as well as super hot

Example:
- Beam focusing effects with specific magnet orientations
- Color shifts in certain prism configurations
- cooling at extreme would imply some level of cold electrical phenomena 
- Combined beams would also mean a stacking of the photon interaction as well if I get what’s occurring correctly 

### Equipment Inventory
**Lasers:**
- Type: green laser pointer, purple laser pointer, blue laser for mounting and a blue laser for lighting campfires, and a dmx laser I don’t bring in very often
- Power: unknown. Blue laser is stronger, and dmx laser is plugged into the wall*
- Count: 3+ used in experiments

**Optics:**
- Pyramid prism
- have used the prisms listed above as well as lenses 
- tubes of Nobel gas
- Normal mirrors
- Spinning mirrors
- Magnetized mirrors
- Spinning magnetized mirrors
- Spinning prisms

**Crystals:**
- Rose quartz (primary)
- Amethyst
- Clear quartz

**Magnets:**
- Neodymium -Strength unknown on both parts, bout the size of a quarter 
- Ceramic

**Documentation:**
- Video count: ~57 [ plus] 
- Storage: Phone camera and YouTube
- Public playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJQR71eWUwaqNvUR5V2DGuYbZyUCJghgE

### Connection to MVRP Framework

**Pattern Recognition:**
Both laser work and MVRP investigate geometric mediation of 
cross-domain energy coupling:

**Laser Experiments (Phase 1):**
Input: Optical (laser light)
Output: Acoustic (sound waves)
Mediator: Crystal + Pyramid geometry

**MVRP (Phase 2):**
Input: Acoustic (528 Hz fork)
Output: Electric (voltage)
Mediator: Water + φ-geometry

**Shared Principles:**
1. Geometric boundaries matter
2. Material properties critical (crystal vs water)
3. Frequency-dependent effects
4. Interference/resonance phenomena
5. Repeatable but unexplained by conventional models

**Credibility Impact:**
Multi-year track record of observing anomalous cross-domain 
effects strengthens MVRP findings. Not isolated observation 
but consistent pattern across different experimental domains.

### Future Work
- Quantify bass hum frequency (audio recording + FFT analysis)
- Test in Faraday cage (isolate from external EM)
- Reproduce with video documentation and timestamps
- Measure laser power, crystal dimensions, geometry precisely
- Integrate findings with MVRP theoretical framework
