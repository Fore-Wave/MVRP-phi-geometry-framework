Testing golden ratio geometry effects on physical coherence - Open Science Framework

MVRP Framework: φ-Geometry Effects on Physical Coherence - Preliminary Dataset v3.1

Authors: Evan Howell

Description: 
Comprehensive experimental framework testing golden ratio (φ≈1.618) geometry effects across electrical and optical domains. Includes preliminary N=11 trials showing 3.5× voltage enhancement, 30% laser beam collimation (first φ-optical report), and 0.810V beam-voltage coupling. Full protocols, data, analysis scripts, and theoretical integration. Open science, <$150 replication cost.
